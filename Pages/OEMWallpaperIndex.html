    <P>By the way, I have to use the terrible album links even with singlar images because imgur refuses to serve direct links anymore on HTML pages. Thanks Imgur! /S There's no guarantee the wallpapers will be the right resolution, so check before using because imgur hates you.    </P>

    <p>I may concider using catbox for single images and imgur for multiwallpaper collections, but i'll be sure to test it beforehand.</p>
