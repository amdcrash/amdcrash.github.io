    <h2>Promotional Disc Recreations</h2>
    <p>These pages contain spotify playlists that recreate promotional CD's released by various companies. I sourced them from the disc database discogs which contains records of nearly every disc release ever made. Note that since many of them are very old, some tracks are not available today.</p>
